            <p>I started my career as a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch. I then went on to start a company called Flibyrd, first making an investment research platform and then pivoting to a mobile app that provides holisitic financial planning and investment recommendations. My failures and unique experiences make me who I am today.</p>
